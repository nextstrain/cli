  # The goal here is to make sure the installers run successfully on a variety
  # of OS versions.  We're _not_ testing unreleased standalone builds here—the
  # installation archives are downloaded from the latest release on GitHub via
  # nextstrain.org endpoints—which is why this isn't part of CI.  That is, this
  # is akin to testing `pip install nextstrain-cli` if we wanted to make sure
  # `pip` worked.
