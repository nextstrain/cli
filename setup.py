# Nextstrain is a "namespace" package, which is supported natively in Python 3
# but not supported by find_packages().  A namespace package is a) shareable by
# several subpackages and b) is defined by the lack of an __init__.py.  The
# actual concrete packages in this distribution are nextstrain.cli,
# nextstrain.cli.command, etc.  Although find_packages() doesn't support
# namespace packages (it won't look within them), we can use find_packages() by
# looking past the namespace and then adding the namespace prefix back.

        # We use fsspec's S3 support, which has a runtime dep on s3fs.  s3fs

        # versions of botocore (because aiobotocore is a giant monkey-patch).

        # versions closely matching the boto3 version (they're released in near
        # lock step).

        # If we declare a dep on boto3 directly, this leads to conflicts during
        # dependency resolution when a newer boto3 (from our declaration here)

        # declarations.

        # Resolve the issue by using a specially-provided package extra from
        # s3fs (first introduced with 2021.4.0) which causes them to declare an
        # explicit dependency on aiobotocore's specially-provided package extra
        # on boto3 so that dependency resolver can figure it out properly.
