# Nextstrain is a "namespace" package, which is supported natively in Python 3
# but not supported by find_packages().  A namespace package is a) shareable by
# several subpackages and b) is defined by the lack of an __init__.py.  The
# actual concrete packages in this distribution are nextstrain.cli,
# nextstrain.cli.command, etc.  Although find_packages() doesn't support
# namespace packages (it won't look within them), we can use find_packages() by
# looking past the namespace and then adding the namespace prefix back.
