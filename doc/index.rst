Nextstrain CLI
==============

.. warning::
   This is the Nextstrain CLI's reference documentation. For the general Nextstrain docs, go here: :doc:`docs.nextstrain.org:index`

This is the documentation for the `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org>`__
command-line interface (CLI)---a program called ``nextstrain``---which aims to
provide a consistent way to run and visualize pathogen builds and access
Nextstrain components like :doc:`Augur <augur:index>` and `Auspice
<https://nextstrain.github.io/auspice/>`__ across computing environments such
as `Docker <https://docker.com>`__, `Conda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__, and `AWS Batch
<https://aws.amazon.com/batch/>`__.

.. note::
    If you're unfamiliar with Nextstrain builds, you may want to follow our
    `quickstart guide
    <https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/quickstart>`__ first and then
    come back here.
