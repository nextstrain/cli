# Nextstrain CLI Development

Development of `nextstrain-cli` happens at <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli>.

We currently target compatibility with Python 3.8 and higher.

Versions for this project follow the [Semantic Versioning rules][].

## Setup

Setup an isolated development environment in `.venv/` with:

    ./devel/setup-venv

Activate the venv to run any of the commands below:

    source .venv/bin/activate

(Or alternatively, run the commands below via `./devel/venv-run â€¦`.)

Now test that you can run:

    nextstrain --help

The development environment includes our dev tools (described below):

    pytest           # runs doctests as well as pyright and flake8
    pyright
    flake8
    make -C doc livehtml

## Running with local changes

The project is installed into editable mode when using the venv setup above, so
any changes you make during development will be used automatically.

If you need to run with local changes in setups without editable mode, you can
run `./bin/nextstrain` to test your local changes without installing them.
(Note that `./bin/nextstrain` is not the script that gets installed by pip as
`nextstrain`; that script is generated by the `entry_points` configuration in
`setup.py`.)

## External resources

Environment variables can be used to change the location or identity of
external resources/services used by some Nextstrain CLI commands.  This is
helpful when performing manual integration testing against development or
testing resources.

When running the [nextstrain.org server][] locally, you can make the
`nextstrain remote` family of commands talk to it instead of the real
nextstrain.org by setting `NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG`, e.g.:

    NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG=http://localhost:5000 \
      nextstrain remote ls nextstrain.org/groups/test

If you need authenticated access and the local server is using the AWS Cognito
resources from our ["testing" configuration][], you can configure `nextstrain`
with the same, e.g.:

    export NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG=http://localhost:5000

    nextstrain login
    nextstrain whoami
    nextstrain remote ls groups/test-private

Most of the times the above is not necessary, however, as you can specify the
local remote explicitly instead of pretending it's nextstrain.org, e.g.:

    nextstrain remote ls http://localhost:5000/groups/test

    nextstrain login http://localhost:5000
    nextstrain whoami http://localhost:5000
    nextstrain remote ls http://localhost:5000/groups/test-private

Setting `NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG` is mostly useful when testing the default-remote
code paths themselves.

## Releasing

New releases are made frequently and tagged in git using a [_signed_ tag][].
There is a `./devel/release` script which will prepare a new release from your
local repository.  It ends with instructions for you on how to push the release
commit/tag.

When a release tag is pushed, the [CI workflow][] builds [source
distributions][] and [built distributions][] (wheels), tests them, and if tests
pass, uploads them to [the nextstrain-cli project on
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nextstrain-cli).

### Recovering from release CI failures

When CI for a release fails due to transient errors (like DNS or other network
issues), it can be recovered by retrying the GitHub Action workflow run.

However, when CI for a release fails due to non-transient errors that require a
code change, the recovery method is to cut a new release.  If only non-packaged
changes were made (e.g. fixes to the CI process itself but not in
`nextstrain`), then bump the version to a [post-release version][] (e.g.
`X.Y.Z.postN`).  Otherwise, use an appropriate semantic version bump.  Update
the changelog to note the unreleased version as such and that the new version
contains all the changes from the unreleased version.  You can compare to
previous unreleased versions for wording.

Two examples of recovering from a failed release:

  * The release of
    [7.3.0](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/blob/7ba087b4/CHANGES.md#730-19-september-2023)
    failed due to issues with CI.
    [CI was fixed](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/pull/314) and
    [7.3.0.post1](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/blob/7ba087b4/CHANGES.md#730post1-19-september-2023)
    was released.

  * The release of
    [6.0.1](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/blob/7ba087b4/CHANGES.md#601-3-january-2023)
    failed and required changes to packaged code.
    [6.0.2](https://github.com/nextstrain/cli/blob/7ba087b4/CHANGES.md#602-3-january-2023)
    was released with the fix.

### Updating the Bioconda recipe

Typically the [autobump PR][] created by BiocondaBot when it notices the PyPI
release will be sufficient.  Look it over and comment:

> @BiocondaBot please add label

to get it reviewed and merged.

However, if there are changes to the minimum Python version or dependency list in `setup.py`, then
create a PR in [bioconda-recipes][] translating the changes in `setup.py` to
[Conda package match specifications][].
Follow instructions at [nextstrain/bioconda-recipes/README.md][].
You'll need to ask that the [autobump PR][] is closed in favor of your own PR.

## Tests

Tests are run with [pytest](https://pytest.org).  To run everything, use:

    ./devel/pytest

This includes the type annotation and static analysis checks described below.

## Type annotations and static analysis

Our goal is to gradually add [type annotations][] to our code so that we can
catch errors earlier and be explicit about the interfaces expected and
provided.  Annotation pairs well with the functional approach taken by the
package.

During development you can run static type checks using [pyright][]:

    $ npx pyright
    ...
    Found 40 source files
    0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 infos
    Completed in 2sec

There are also many [editor integrations for Pyright][].

The [`typing_extensions`][] module should be used for features not yet available
in the the standard `typings` module of supported Python versions.

We also use [Flake8][] for some static analysis checks focusing on runtime
safety and correctness.  You can run them like this:

    $ flake8
    # No output is good!

## Documentation

A Sphinx project for Nextstrain CLI's documentation, primarily [reference and
explanatory material](https://documentation.divio.com), lives in the `doc/`
directory.  Pages are written in reStructuredText (rST), though some older
pages originally written in Markdown haven't been converted yet.

To locally build the HTML version of the documentation (i.e. what's served at
<https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/cli/>), run:

    $ make -C doc livehtml

This will start a server on <http://localhost:8000> which you can browse.
Changes to source documentation files will be reflected automatically.

The rST source documentation files for the individual `nextstrain` commands are
generated from the Python source files and checked into version control.
Changes should be kept in sync by regenerating with:

    $ ./devel/generate-command-doc

This will emit the file paths it updates, if any.  This also happens
automatically as part of the documentation build process to ensure the built
docs always reflect the current source.   Tests run in CI ensure the generated
files are current and don't vary based on ambient environmental factors.

The `devel/generate-command-doc` program also has `--diff` and `--check` modes
which may be helpful during development; see `--help` for details.
