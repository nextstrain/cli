Development of `nextstrain-cli` happens at <https://github.com/nextstrain/cli>.

We currently target compatibility with Python 3.6 and higher.

Versions for this project follow the [Semantic Versioning rules][].

## Setup

Setup an isolated development environment in `.venv/` with:

    ./devel/setup-venv

Activate the venv to run any of the commands below:

    source .venv/bin/activate

(Or alternatively, run the commands below via `./devel/venv-run …`.)

Now test that you can run:

    nextstrain --help

The development environment includes our dev tools (described below):

    pytest           # runs doctests as well as mypy and flake8
    mypy -p nextstrain.cli
    flake8

## Running with local changes

The project is installed into editable mode when using the venv setup above, so
any changes you make during development will be used automatically.

If you need to run with local changes in setups without editable mode, you can
run `./bin/nextstrain` to test your local changes without installing them.
(Note that `./bin/nextstrain` is not the script that gets installed by pip as
`nextstrain`; that script is generated by the `entry_points` configuration in
`setup.py`.)

## Releasing

New releases are made frequently and tagged in git using a [_signed_ tag][].
There is a `./devel/release` script which will prepare a new release from your
local repository.  It ends with instructions for you on how to push the release
commit/tag.

When a release tag is pushed, the [CI workflow][] builds [source
distributions][] and [built distributions][] (wheels), tests them, and if tests
pass, uploads them to [the nextstrain-cli project on
PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nextstrain-cli).

## Tests

Tests are run with [pytest](https://pytest.org).  To run everything, use:

    pytest

This includes the type annotation and static analysis checks described below.

## Type annotations and static analysis

Our goal is to gradually add [type annotations][] to our code so that we can
catch errors earlier and be explicit about the interfaces expected and
provided.  Annotation pairs well with the functional approach taken by the
package.

During development you can run static type checks using [mypy][]:

    $ mypy nextstrain
    # No output is good!

and [pyright][]:

    $ npx pyright
    ...
    Found 40 source files
    0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 infos
    Completed in 2sec

There are also many [editor integrations for mypy][], and Pyright is integrated
into VS Code's Python support.

The [`typing_extensions`][] module should be used for features added to the
standard `typings` module after 3.6.

We also use [Flake8][] for some static analysis checks focusing on runtime
safety and correctness.  You can run them like this:

    $ flake8
    # No output is good!
