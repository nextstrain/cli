"""
.. versionadded:: 3.1.0

The ``nextstrain remote`` family of commands can
:doc:`list </commands/remote/list>`,
:doc:`download </commands/remote/download>`,
:doc:`upload </commands/remote/upload>`,
and :doc:`delete </commands/remote/delete>`
Nextstrain :term:`datasets <docs:dataset>` and :term:`narratives
<docs:narrative>` hosted on `nextstrain.org <https://nextstrain.org>`_.  This
functionality is primarily intended for users to manage the contents of their
:doc:`Nextstrain Groups <docs:learn/groups/index>`, but any public dataset or
narrative may be downloaded.


Remote paths
============

Nextstrain.org_ datasets and narratives are recognized by the same URLs used to
view them on the web, e.g. ``https://nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global``.

As a convenience, the scheme (``https://``) may be omitted, e.g.
``nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global``.

As a further convenience for Nextstrain Groups URLs, the domain
(``nextstrain.org``) may also be omitted, e.g.  ``groups/blab/sars-like-cov``
works as well as ``https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/sars-like-cov``.


Authentication
==============

Read-only actions may be performed against public paths without authentication.
To manage a private Nextstrain Group or upload/delete a public path, first
login with nextstrain.org_ credentials using the :doc:`/commands/login`
command.


Environment variables
=====================

.. warning::
    For development only.  You don't need to set these during normal operation.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG

    Base URL to use instead of ``https://nextstrain.org`` when accessing
    remote resources, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: shell

        NEXTSTRAIN_DOT_ORG=http://localhost:5000 nextstrain remote ls nextstrain.org

    will interact with ``http://localhost:5000`` instead of nextstrain.org_.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_DISABLE_NARRATIVE_IMAGE_EMBEDDING

    Set to any non-empty value to disable the automatic embedding of local
    images into narratives during upload.  The narrative's Markdown contents
    will be uploaded as-is, but any local images referenced by it will almost
    certainly be broken.
