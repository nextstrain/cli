"""
Run commands remotely on AWS Batch inside the Nextstrain container image.

`AWS Batch <https://aws.amazon.com/batch/>`__ is an advanced computing
platform which allows you to launch and monitor Nextstrain builds in the
cloud from the comfort of your own computer. The same image used by the local
Docker runtime is used by AWS Batch, making your builds more reproducible, and
builds have access to computers with very large CPU and memory allocations if
necessary.

.. versionadded:: 1.7.0


.. _aws-batch-setup:

Setup
=====

The initial setup is quite a bit more involved than most runtimes, but
:doc:`detailed instructions </aws-batch>` are available.

Once you've set up AWS, proceed with ``nextstrain setup aws-batch``.


.. _aws-batch-config:

Config file variables
=====================

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, specified in the
:doc:`config file </config/file>`.

.. glossary::

    :index:`aws-batch.job <configuration variable; aws-batch.job>`
        Default for ``--aws-batch-job``.

    :index:`aws-batch.queue <configuration variable; aws-batch.queue>`
        Default for ``--aws-batch-queue``.

    :index:`aws-batch.s3-bucket <configuration variable; aws-batch.s3-bucket>`
        Default for ``--aws-batch-bucket``.

    :index:`aws-batch.cpus <configuration variable; aws-batch.cpus>`
        Default for ``--aws-batch-cpus``.

    :index:`aws-batch.memory <configuration variable; aws-batch.memory>`
        Default for ``--aws-batch-memory``.


.. _aws-batch-env:

Environment variables
=====================

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, potentially overriding
defaults set by `config file variables`_.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_AWS_BATCH_JOB

    Default for ``--aws-batch-job``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_AWS_BATCH_QUEUE

    Default for ``--aws-batch-queue``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_AWS_BATCH_S3_BUCKET

    Default for ``--aws-batch-bucket``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_AWS_BATCH_CPUS

    Default for ``--aws-batch-cpus``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_AWS_BATCH_MEMORY

    Default for ``--aws-batch-memory``.
