"""
Run commands with access to a fully-managed Conda environment.

`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ is a very popular
packaging system freely-available for all platforms. When you use Nextstrain
CLI's built-in Conda support, you don't need to install any other Nextstrain
software dependencies yourself as validated versions are already bundled into a
package (`nextstrain-base`_) by the Nextstrain team and automatically managed
in an isolated location (isolated even from other Conda environments you may
manage yourself).

.. _nextstrain-base: https://github.com/nextstrain/conda-base


.. versionadded:: 5.0.0


.. _conda-setup:

Setup
=====

On macOS and Linux, run ``nextstrain setup conda`` to get started.

This will download compressed packages totaling about 450 MB in size which
expand to a final on-disk size of about 2 GB.  Transient disk usage during this
process peaks at about 3 GB.  These numbers are current as of August 2023, as
observed on Linux.  Numbers will vary over time, with a tendency to slowly
increase, and vary slightly by OS.

This runtime is not directly supported on Windows, but you can use `WSL2
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index>`__ to "switch" to
Linux and run the above setup command.


.. _conda-env:

Environment variables
=====================

.. warning::
    For development only.  You don't need to set these during normal operation.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_CHANNEL

    Conda channel name (or URL) to use for Nextstrain packages not otherwise
    available via Bioconda (e.g. ``nextstrain-base``).

    Defaults to ``nextstrain``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_BASE_PACKAGE

    Conda meta-package name to use for the Nextstrain base runtime dependencies.

    May be a two- or three-part `Conda package match spec`_ instead of just a
    package name.  Note that a ``conda install``-style package spec, with a
    single ``=`` or without spaces, is not supported.

    Defaults to ``nextstrain-base``.

    .. _Conda package match spec: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/pkg-specs.html#package-match-specifications

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_MICROMAMBA_VERSION

    Version of Micromamba to use for setup and upgrade of the Conda runtime
    env.  Must be a version available from the `conda-forge channel
    <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/micromamba/>`__, or the special string
    ``latest``.

    Defaults to ``1.5.8``.

    Parse *version* into a PEP-440-compliant :cls:`Version` object, by hook or

    If *version* isn't already PEP-440 compliant, then it is parsed as a
    PEP-440 local version label after replacing with ``.`` any characters not
    matching ``a-z``, ``A-Z``, ``0-9``, ``.``, ``_``, or ``-``.  The comparison
    semantics for local version labels amount to a string- and integer-based
    comparison by parts ("segments"), which is super good enough for our
    purposes here.  The full local version identifier produced for versions
    parsed in this way always contains a public version identifier component of
    ``0.dev0`` so it compares lowest against other public version identifiers.
