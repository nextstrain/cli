"""
Run commands with access to a fully-managed Conda environment.

`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ is a very popular
packaging system freely-available for all platforms. When you use Nextstrain
CLI's built-in Conda support, you don't need to install any other Nextstrain
software dependencies yourself as validated versions are already bundled into a
package (`nextstrain-base`_) by the Nextstrain team and automatically managed
in an isolated location (isolated even from other Conda environments you may
manage yourself).

.. _nextstrain-base: https://github.com/nextstrain/conda-base


.. versionadded:: 5.0.0


.. _conda-setup:

Setup
=====

On macOS and Linux, run ``nextstrain setup conda`` to get started.

This will download compressed packages totaling about 450 MB in size which
expand to a final on-disk size of about 2 GB.  Transient disk usage during this
process peaks at about 3 GB.  These numbers are current as of August 2023, as
observed on Linux.  Numbers will vary over time, with a tendency to slowly
increase, and vary slightly by OS.

This runtime is not directly supported on Windows, but you can use `WSL2
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index>`__ to "switch" to
Linux and run the above setup command.


.. _conda-env:

Environment variables
=====================

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_CHANNEL_ALIAS

    The base URL to prepend to channel names.  Equivalent to the |channel_alias
    Conda config setting|_.

    Useful if you want to use a Conda package mirror that's not the default
    (i.e. not Anaconda's).

    Defaults to the Conda ecosystem's default of
    `<https://conda.anaconda.org/>`__.

.. |channel_alias Conda config setting| replace:: ``channel_alias`` Conda config setting
.. _channel_alias Conda config setting: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/settings.html#set-ch-alias


.. warning::
    The remaining variables are for development only.  You don't need to set
    these during normal operation.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_CHANNEL

    Conda channel name (or URL) to use for Nextstrain packages not otherwise
    available via Bioconda (e.g. ``nextstrain-base``).

    Defaults to ``nextstrain``.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_BASE_PACKAGE

    Conda meta-package name to use for the Nextstrain base runtime dependencies.

    May be a two- or three-part `Conda package match spec`_ instead of just a
    package name.  Note that a ``conda install``-style package spec, with a
    single ``=`` or without spaces, is not supported.

    Defaults to ``nextstrain-base``.

    .. _Conda package match spec: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/pkg-specs.html#package-match-specifications

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_MICROMAMBA_URL

    URL of a Micromamba release tarball (e.g. Conda package) to use for setup
    and updates.

    May be a full URL or a relative URL to be joined with
    :envvar:`NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_CHANNEL_ALIAS`.  Any occurrence of ``{subdir}``
    will be replaced with the current platform's Conda subdir value.

    Replaces the previously-supported development environment variable
    ``NEXTSTRAIN_CONDA_MICROMAMBA_VERSION``.

    Defaults to ``conda-forge/{subdir}/micromamba-1.5.8-0.tar.bz2``.
