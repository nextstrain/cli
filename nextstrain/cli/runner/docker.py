"""
Run commands inside a container image using Docker.

`Docker <https://docker.com>`__ is a very popular container system
freely-available for all platforms. When you use Docker with the Nextstrain
CLI, you don't need to install any other Nextstrain software dependencies as
validated versions are already bundled into a container image
(`nextstrain/base`_) by the Nextstrain team.


.. _nextstrain/base: https://github.com/nextstrain/docker-base


.. _docker-setup:

Setup
=====

.. hint::
   This is a reference page with brief pointers for set up.  For a more
   comprehensive installation guide, please see `our general Nextstrain
   installation page <https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/install.html>`__.

On macOS, download and install `Docker Desktop`_, also known previously as
"Docker for Mac".

On Linux, install Docker with the standard package manager. For example, on
Ubuntu, you can install Docker with ``sudo apt install docker.io``.

On Windows, install `Docker Desktop`_ with its support for a WSL2 backend.

Once you've installed Docker, proceed with ``nextstrain setup docker``.

This will download compressed image layers totaling about 750 MB in size which
expand to a final on-disk size of about 2 GB.  Transient disk usage during this
process peaks at about 3 GB.  These numbers are current as of August 2023, as
observed on Linux.  Numbers will vary over time, with a tendency to slowly
increase, and vary slightly by OS.

.. _Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop


.. _docker-config:

Config file variables
=====================

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, specified in the
:doc:`config file </config/file>`.

.. glossary::

    :index:`docker.image <configuration variable; docker.image>`
        Default for ``--image`` when using the Docker runtime, e.g.
        ``nextstrain/base:build-20230623T174208Z``.

        Typically set initially by ``nextstrain setup`` and subsequently by
        ``nextstrain update``.


.. _docker-env:

Environment variables
=====================

.. warning::
    For development only.  You don't need to set these during normal operation.

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, potentially overriding
defaults set by `config file variables`_.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_DOCKER_IMAGE

    Default for ``--image`` when using the Docker runtime.

    Our "latest" tag always has a "build-*" counterpart.  Using a "build-*" tag
