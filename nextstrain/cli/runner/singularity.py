"""
Run commands inside a container image using Singularity.

Singularity is a container system freely-available for Linux platforms.  It is
commonly available on institutional HPC systems as an alternative to Docker,
which is often not supported on such systems.  When you use Singularity with
the Nextstrain CLI, you don't need to install any other Nextstrain software
dependencies as validated versions are already bundled into a container image
by the Nextstrain team.

The Singularity runtime uses the same images built for the Docker runtime by
automatically converting them to local Singularity images.  Local images are
stored as files named
:file:`~/.nextstrain/runtimes/singularity/images/{repository}/{tag}.sif`.

.. versionadded:: 6.1.0


.. _singularity-setup:

Setup
=====

Run ``nextstrain setup singularity`` to get started.
Singularity version 3.0.0 or newer is required, but we recommend at least
version 3.10.0 or newer when possible.

This will download image layers totaling about 750 MB in size which are
converted to a final on-disk image of about 650 MB.  Transient disk usage
during this process peaks at about 2 GB.  These numbers are current as of
August 2023, as observed on Linux.  Numbers will vary over time, with a
tendency to slowly increase, and vary slightly by OS.

Note that the Singularity project forked into two separate projects in late
2021: `SingularityCE`_ under `Sylabs`_ and `Apptainer`_ under the `Linux
Foundation`_.  Either fork should work with Nextstrain CLI, as both projects
still provide very similar interfaces and functionality via the ``singularity``
command.  You can read `Sylab's announcement`_ and `Apptainer's announcement`_
for more information on the fork.

.. _SingularityCE: https://sylabs.io/singularity/
.. _Sylabs: https://sylabs.io/
.. _Apptainer: https://apptainer.org
.. _Linux Foundation: https://www.linuxfoundation.org/
.. _Sylab's announcement: https://sylabs.io/2022/06/singularityce-is-singularity/
.. _Apptainer's announcement: https://apptainer.org/news/community-announcement-20211130


.. _singularity-config:

Config file variables
=====================

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, specified in the
:doc:`config file </config/file>`.

.. glossary::

    :index:`singularity.image <configuration variable; singularity.image>`
        Default for ``--image`` when using the Singularity runtime, e.g.
        ``docker://nextstrain/base:build-20230525T143814Z``.

        Typically set initially by ``nextstrain setup`` and subsequently by
        ``nextstrain update``.


.. _singularity-env:

Environment variables
=====================

.. warning::
    For development only.  You don't need to set these during normal operation.

Defaults for the corresponding command line options, potentially overriding
defaults set by `config file variables`_.

.. envvar:: NEXTSTRAIN_SINGULARITY_IMAGE

    Default for ``--image`` when using the Singularity runtime.
