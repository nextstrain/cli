"""
Runs a pathogen build in a Nextstrain runtime.

The build directory should contain a Snakefile, which will be run with
snakemake.

You need at least one runtime available to run a build.  You can test if the
Docker, Conda, Singularity, ambient, or AWS Batch runtimes are properly
supported on your computer by running::

    nextstrain check-setup

The `nextstrain build` command is designed to cleanly separate the Nextstrain
build interface from provisioning a runtime environment, so that running builds
is as easy as possible.  It also lets us more seamlessly make runtime
changes in the future as desired or necessary.
