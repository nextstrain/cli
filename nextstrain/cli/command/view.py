"""
Visualizes a completed pathogen builds or narratives in Auspice, the Nextstrain
visualization app.

:option:`<path>` may be a `dataset (.json) file`_ or `narrative (.md) file`_ to start
Auspice and directly open the specified dataset or narrative in a browser.
Adjacent datasets and/or narratives may also be viewable as an appropriate data
directory for Auspice is automatically inferred from the file path.

:option:`<path>` may also be a directory with one of the following layouts::

    <path>/
    ├── auspice/
    │   └── *.json
    └── narratives/
        └── *.md

    <path>/
    ├── auspice/
    │   └── *.json
    └── *.md

    <path>/
    ├── *.json
    └── narratives/
        └── *.md

    <path>/
    ├── *.json
    └── *.md

Dataset and narrative files will be served, respectively, from **auspice**
and/or **narratives** subdirectories under the given :option:`<path>` if the
subdirectories exist.  Otherwise, files will be served from the given directory
:option:`<path>` itself.

If your pathogen build directory follows our conventional layout by containing
an **auspice** directory (and optionally a **narratives** directory), then you
can give `nextstrain view` the same path as you do `nextstrain build`.

Note that by convention files named **README.md** or **group-overview.md** will
be ignored for the purposes of finding available narratives.
